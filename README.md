### Project Features

1. **Machine Learning**:
   - Machine Learning: Building a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model using TensorFlow to predict insomnia based on survey data. The process included cleaning and preprocessing data, such as handling missing values, normalizing features, and encoding categorical variables. The model was trained with multiple layers using ReLU activation and dropout for regularization, optimized with the SGD optimizer, and validated to prevent overfitting. After tuning hyperparameters for better accuracy, the final model was converted into TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) format with metadata, making it lightweight and ready for deployment on mobile devices.

   
2. **Mobile Development**:
   -  Using a trained machine learning model to analyze data or detect insomnia, the model is integrated into an application using TensorFlow Lite to provide results based on survey inputs and offer related diagnoses and recommendations. The user interface (UI) is designed to be user-friendly, 	incorporating elements like a clock fetched from an API, along with features to display sleep history records and several other functionalities.

 

3. **Cloud Computing**:
   - Using Express.js and Cloud MySQL as a database in App Engine. This application has endpoints for login, viewing profile, and displaying the current time. By using Express.js, the application can be run easily and efficiently. Cloud MySQL is used as a database to store user data. This application can also be integrated with other services such as authentication and authorization. Thus, the application can become safer and more secure. In addition, this application can also be deployed to App Engine easily, so that it can be accessed by users from anywhere.
